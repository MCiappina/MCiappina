I've always loved technology in one way or another: either playing games or spending hours and hours on the internet studying. In 2020, I decided I would try my way into this industry.

I went to school at UNICAMP for a bachelors degree in Music. I worked teaching music to children for 2 years, where I had to learn how to play new instruments from scratch, which greatly improved my ability to act out on the fly. As an intern, I had to take a lot of responsability planning classes and teaching subjects solo when needs arose.

I was self-taught in Music with the help of resources on the web back in the day, which made me really tech savy, so one day I figured: why not try out learning some web development skills? I started taking courses such as FreeCodeCamp and CodeCademy and it clicked: this is what I wanted to do!

It took me some time to finally decide on taking Ironhack's bootcamp to polish my React, MongoDB, Express, Node, and more! It's been a great experience so far!

I'm thrilled about game development and full-stack development. If you have any questions or want to have a talk about tech, you can reach me on matheus.ciappina@gmail.com
